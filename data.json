    "name": "Nested Squares",
    "description": "This work is inspired by nested square patterns and line thickness variations. I created a piece featuring a grid of nested squares with different stroke weights and colors. The squares get smaller toward the center, giving a subtle impression of being in space."

    "description": "The size of each square changes depending on how far it is from the center. Each square also has slightly different stroke thickness and color, creating a lively, abstract pattern."
